## General Thoughts

- The website design isn't very responsive.  Lots of elements run off the page and it doesn't resize if I resize the screen
- The advanced search feature is very impressive.  
- Very neat About page.  Looks super professional!
- I'm not sure what the save button on the recipes is supposed to do?
- The logo looks really cool!  Seriously, who made that?
- Very good README!

## Code Comments

- [To go above and beyond, it would've been great to display this error message on the page somewhere, as opposed to just in the console](https://github.com/Amir-Hackett/RecipEZ/blob/50dd46a322840cf39932fe81e3de2cbca43bd51d/assets/js/script.js#L19-L24)
- [This is a pretty big function.  Could you have broken it up into smaller subfunctions?](https://github.com/Amir-Hackett/RecipEZ/blob/50dd46a322840cf39932fe81e3de2cbca43bd51d/assets/js/script.js#L45-L112)

- [Don't code litter!  Remove commented out code!](https://github.com/Amir-Hackett/RecipEZ/blob/50dd46a322840cf39932fe81e3de2cbca43bd51d/assets/js/script.js#L275-L287)

## Closing Thoughts

- Ambitious use of filtering.  Definitely makes your project stand out.
